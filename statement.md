# Project Statement: Python Tic-Tac-Toe with AI Integration

## 1. Problem Statement
In the realm of digital entertainment and educational programming, there is often a gap between simple "Hello World" applications and complex software systems. Many aspiring developers and logic enthusiasts lack accessible examples of how classic Game Theory concepts are applied in real-world coding scenarios.

Additionally, casual users seeking lightweight mental exercises often face bloated applications with unnecessary features. This project solves these issues by delivering a streamlined, logic-driven Tic-Tac-Toe game. It provides a challenging environment for users to test their strategic skills against an intelligent agent while serving as a clear, practical demonstration of algorithmic AI implementation in Python.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The project focuses on the development and deployment of a single-player strategy game.

**In Scope:**
* **Core Game Engine:** Implementation of standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules, including a 3x3 grid, turn alternation, and symbol placement (X/O).
* **Artificial Intelligence:** Integration of a decision-making algorithm (e.g., Minimax) to control the computer opponent.
* **User Interface:** A clear interface (CLI or GUI) for move input and board visualization.
* **Game State Management:** Real-time validation of win, loss, and draw conditions.

**Out of Scope:**
* Multiplayer network capabilities (online PvP).
* User account management or persistent database storage.
* Mobile application frameworks.

## 3. Target Users
* **Casual Gamers:** Individuals seeking quick, intellectual entertainment without complex setups.
* **Computer Science Students:** Learners studying game development, Python syntax, or AI fundamentals.
* **Algorithm Enthusiasts:** Users interested in testing their logic against a programmed bot.
* **Open Source Contributors:** Developers looking to optimize or expand upon a clean Python codebase.

## 4. High-Level Features
* ** Smart AI Opponent:** An adaptive computer player capable of blocking moves and calculating winning paths.
* ** Dynamic Grid System:** A 3x3 board that updates instantaneously to reflect the current game state.
* ** Input Validation:** Robust error handling to ensure players cannot select occupied cells or invalid coordinates.
* ** Win/Draw Detection:** Automatic recognition of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal victories, as well as stalemate scenarios.
* ** Replayability:** Options to reset the game board instantly for continuous play sessions.
