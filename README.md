# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI

Adding a simple AI to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game:

## 3 modes:
- Player vs. Player (2 - player mode)
- Player vs. AI (1 - player mode)
- AI vs. AI (*for fun*)
  
## Features
Three Distinct Game Modes:

- Player vs. Computer: Challenge an AI that blocks your moves and tries to win.

- Player vs. Player: Classic local multiplayer mode.

- Computer vs. Computer: Watch two AI agents battle it out.

## Smart AI Logic: The computer opponent uses a heuristic algorithm to:

- Detect winning moves and take them immediately.

- Detect opponent's winning moves to block them.

- Prioritize strategic positions (Corners > Center > Edges)

#### *Logic*
- Optimal Tic Tac Toe Moves

  ## Technologies/Tools Used
- Programming Language: Python 3.x

- Standard Libraries:

- random (For randomizing starting turns and AI logic)

- time (For adding dramatic delays in AI vs AI mode)

- Interface: Console/Terminal

## How to install
-  Clone or Download the Repository
-If you have Git installed:
-  navigate to the Directory
- Open your terminal/command prompt and change directory (cd) to where you saved the files:

## Running the Game
- Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux).

- Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

- Run the following command: python tictactoe.py

## instructions for Testing
- To test the functionality of the game, follow these steps:

1-  Test Input Handling
2- Run the game and select Mode 1 (Player vs Player).

3- When asked for a position, try entering a letter (e.g., 'a') or a number outside 1-9 (e.g., '12').

4- Expected Result: The game should catch the error and display INVALID INPUT! Please Try Again!.

## DEMO:
#### The board will be printed out every time a player makes a move.
The board will look like this!
The positions of this 3 x 3 board is same as the **keypad on the right side of your key board**.


#### You just have to input the position(1-9).img
